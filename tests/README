HIC SUNT DRACONES!

These are simple test programs for testing FLIPS. They are left here as examples. Most of them are not commented, and some of them are so old that even we do not know what they do. Sometime, in the distant future, we may write a proper test suite for FLIPS. Until then, good luck and good night.
