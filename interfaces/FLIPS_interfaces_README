This is README for FLIPS interfaces for R and MATLAB.


These instructions are valid for Mac OS X and *NIX systems. If you are using Windows, you are on your own _at_the_moment_. If you do not know what to do, use the precompiled binaries, if available. 

There exist precompiled binary versions for these interfaces. They can be found in KavaroWiki (http://mep.fi/mediawiki/index.php/FLIPS_interfaces).

Both interfaces use compiled Fortran program called "flipseng30" to do the actual FLIPS magic. 

You can compile flipseng _after_ building FLIPS module by giving command

	make
	
in FLIPS "interfaces" directory (the same directory where this file is).
	
Depending on the interface you are going to use, you must move/copy the resulting flipseng30 executable into suitable location (somewhere in your path, like /usr/local/bin).




rflips (R interface for FLIPS)
-------------------------------

Move/copy "flipseng30" somewhere in your PATH. After this install the rflips package into R by giving command

	sudo R CMD INSTALL rflips
	
in the "interfaces" directory.

FLIPS interface is loaded in R by giving command "library(flips)". Help about flips can be obtained by command "help(flips)"




m_flips (MATLAB interface for FLIPS)
-------------------------------------

Copy the folder "m_flips" somewhere where you keep your MATLAB toolboxes. Run "pathtool" in the MATLAB command line and add "m_flips" and its subfolders into the MATLAB search path.

Copy the file "flipseng30" somewhere where you keep your executables. Open the file m_flips/@flips/private/flipspath.m and set the location of the executable file "flipseng30" in the variable FLIPSEngPath. Default is "/usr/local/bin", so if you copied "flipseng30" there, you do not have to make changes in the file "flipspath.m".

Help can be obtained by command "help m_flips".
