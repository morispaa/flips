These are very Q'n'D instructions for building FLIPS module/library.



IMPORTANT NOTICE TO MAC OS X USERS!
-----------------------------------

Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) ships with version 1.4.6 of the macro processor m4 which is buggy! In order to be able to compile FLIPS in Mac OS X platform
it is necessary to update m4 to the version (at least) 1.4.11 (also 1.4.9 will work, but then again 1.4.10 is not functioning properly in OS X. Go figure.).

Sources of m4 can be obtained from GNU site:

	http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/

and the building & installation goes through with the standard GNU CMSMI (configure && make && sudo make install) procedure.

In any reasonable modern Linux system there should be no problem.

In Windows systems... Well, I have no idea. Sorry.



Building FLIPS
--------------

There is a basic configure script, so you could try it first, i.e.,

./configure
make

The file Make.defs contains all flags required by make, so you can modify it if
necessary.

If the configure script fails for some reason, try to modify the file Make.defs by yourself and build FLIPS by giving command

make

See FLIPS Manual (doc/flipsMan.pdf) for more information.


Building and installing FLIPS interfaces for R and/or MATLAB
------------------------------------------------------------

Compile flipseng (FLIPS Engine) using command

make flipseng

AFTER you have built FLIPS module and library/object file (above).

See interfaces/FLIPS_interfaces_README for installation instructions.


Building FLIPS test programs
----------------------------

You can find a mixed bunch of test programs in directory tests. See tests/README.



If you have problems and/or questions, or you find bugs in FLIPS, do not hesitate to mail me!
